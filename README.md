# **Supply Chain Management System**

Welcome to the **SupplySage** the **Supply Chain Management System** project! This system aims to optimize the delivery process for a shipping company by predicting potential delays in deliveries using machine learning. The application uses random forest classification to predict the likelihood of delivery delays based on various factors such as shipping routes, weather conditions, and historical data.

ðŸš§ ## **Project Status**

**Delivery Delay Prediction:** Predicting delays using machine learning (Random Forest Classifier).
**Data Processing:** Gathering data on shipping routes, weather, and delivery status(used Kaggle dataset).
**User Interface:** React-based front-end for visualizing data and predictions.
**Backend API:** Flask-based backend for processing and serving predictions.

ðŸ›  ## **Technologies Used**

**Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Backend:** Flask (Python)
**Machine Learning:** Random Forest Classification (Sci-kit Learn)
**Database:** MySQL
**API:** RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend
